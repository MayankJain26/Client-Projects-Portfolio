# Client Projects Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is a curated portfolio of **real-world client projects** that I have designed, developed, and deployed for **live production environments**.  
Each client’s work is organized into a **dedicated folder**, serving as a structured showcase of delivered solutions across different industries and business domains.
